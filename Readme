This repository is used to create solution by UCI Merage MSBA graduate students team for challenge statement 4 of the FloridaHacksWithIBM event conducted by IBM. 

Challenge Statement #4 - Power Consumption

Florida has one of the largest per capita consumptions of energy in the United States. The bulk of this energy is drawn from fossil fuels leading to high carbon emissions. Currently there is a lack of public and private spending and initiatives in the Sunshine State for use of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind. 



Participants are invited to contribute to help develop applications for facilitating higher usages of renewable energy sources and optimize for efficient energy usage for all types of resources. 

 

How can we:

Analyze and target locations for renewable energy sources

Optimize power generation to reduce overproduction 

Target and reduce areas of inefficient energy usage
